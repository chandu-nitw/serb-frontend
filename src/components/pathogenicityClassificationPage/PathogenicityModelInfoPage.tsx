                In this model, XGBoost algorithm was used to classify MECP2 gene mutations based on extracted genomic features. Categorical variables were one-hot encoded, clinical labels were binarized, and continuous features were normalized using Min-Max scaling. The dataset was then split into training and testing sets. Key hyperparameters like tree depth and learning rate were optimized using grid search. XGBoostâ€™s ensemble learning approach helped reduce overfitting and improve generalization. Through iterative boosting and careful tuning, the model effectively distinguished pathogenic from benign mutations. The final model demonstrated strong performance, highlighting the potential of tree-based methods in genomic variant classification.
